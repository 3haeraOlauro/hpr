In the book, Akhtar also reflects on some of the memorable moments of his career, such as his debut against West Indies in 1997, his hat-trick against Australia in 2002, his record-breaking delivery of 161.3 km/h against England in 2003, and his last World Cup appearance in 2011. He also discusses some of the challenges and struggles that he faced, such as his chronic knee injury, his disciplinary issues, his doping ban and his legal battles.
 
Akhtar's autobiography is not only a chronicle of his cricketing exploits, but also a glimpse into his personality and mindset.

He also acknowledges that he was prone to making mistakes and losing his temper, and that he sometimes hurt himself and others with his words and actions.
