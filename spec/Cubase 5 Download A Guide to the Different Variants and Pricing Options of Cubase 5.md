## Step 1: Get a Cubase 5 License
 
Cubase 5 is not a free software, so you will need to purchase a license from Steinberg or an authorized dealer. You can choose between a USB-eLicenser or a Soft-eLicenser, depending on your preference. A USB-eLicenser is a physical device that you plug into your computer to activate Cubase 5, while a Soft-eLicenser is a software application that stores your license on your hard drive.
 
Once you have your license, you will receive a Download Access Code (DAC) via email. You will need this code to download Cubase 5 in the next step.
  
## Step 2: Download and Install the Steinberg Download Assistant
 
The Steinberg Download Assistant is a free application that allows you to download updates, installers, operation manuals, and other files for Steinberg software. You can download it from the Steinberg website[^2^]. After downloading the file, run the installer and follow the instructions to complete the installation.
  
## Step 3: Download Cubase 5 with the Steinberg Download Assistant
 
Launch the Steinberg Download Assistant and log in with your MySteinberg account. If you don't have an account yet, you can create one for free on the Steinberg website. Then, click on "Enter Download Access Code" and enter your DAC that you received with your license. You will see Cubase 5 in the list of available downloads. Click on "Download" and choose a location on your computer where you want to save the file.
 
The file that you download is an ISO image that contains all the data necessary for a complete installation of Cubase 5. You will need to burn this image to a DVD or mount it as a virtual drive on your computer. On Mac OS X and Windows 8 or later, you can open ISO images as virtual drives directly by double-clicking them. On older Windows versions, you will need a third-party software like WinCDEmu or Cyberduck to do so.
  
## Step 4: Install Cubase 5 from the ISO Image
 
Once you have burned or mounted the ISO image, open it and run the setup.exe file (Windows) or the Cubase 5 Installer.app file (Mac). Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation process. You may need to insert the original Cubase 5 installation DVD during the update process.
 
After installing Cubase 5, you will need to activate it with your license. If you have a USB-eLicenser, make sure it is connected to your computer before launching Cubase 5. If you have a Soft-eLicenser, launch the eLicenser Control Center application and enter your activation code that you received with your license.
