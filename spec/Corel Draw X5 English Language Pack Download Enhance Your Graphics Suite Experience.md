# How to Change the Language of Corel Draw X5 to English
 
If you have installed Corel Draw X5 in a language that you do not understand, you may want to change it to English. However, changing the language of Corel Draw X5 is not as simple as clicking a button. You need to install the English language pack and modify the settings of the program. Here are the steps to do it:
 
1. Download the English language pack from [Corel's website](https://www.corel.com/en/free-trials/). You can choose the trial version or buy the full version if you have a valid license key.
2. Close any open applications and run the language pack installer. Follow the instructions on the screen and choose English as the language.
3. Open Corel Draw X5 and click Tools > Options. In the list of categories, click Global.
4. Choose English from the Select the language for the user interface list box. If you want to change the language of the user interface and Help when you start the program, enable the Ask me the next time the software starts check box.
5. Restart Corel Draw X5 and enjoy using it in English.

If you want to add more languages for writing tools, such as spell check and grammar check, you can do so by modifying or repairing your Corel Draw X5 installation. You can find more details on how to do that [here](http://product.corel.com/help/CorelDRAW/540223850/Main/EN/Documentation/CorelDRAW-Changing-languages.html).
